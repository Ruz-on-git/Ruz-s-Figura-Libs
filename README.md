# Ruz's Figura libs
Welcome to my library of random projects. I make random things that peak my interest.

A quick disclosure: the libraries in this repository were created with the assistance of AI, mainly for documentation and bug fixing.

Feel free to use, fork, modify, and rip apart my libraries as you wish. I’m not the best with Lua, but I know there are some amazing people in the community who can probably optimise or build on my ideas to make something cool, which I’m excited to see.

Current libaries:
- [Join In Animations](https://github.com/Ruz-on-git/Ruz-s-Figura-Libs/tree/main/Libs/Join%20In%20Animations) - A libary used for syncing two player animations.
- [Offload Animations](https://github.com/Ruz-on-git/Ruz-s-Figura-Libs/tree/main/Libs/Offload%20Animations) - A libary used for removing animations from the model file to reduce the size and instead stream them to other player though pings. The main use is for Join in animations.
- [Just Communicate](https://github.com/Ruz-on-git/Ruz-s-Figura-Libs/tree/main/Libs/Just%20Communicate) - A libary used for sending large amounts of data between two people.
- [Ruz Utils](https://github.com/Ruz-on-git/Ruz-s-Figura-Libs/tree/main/Libs/Ruz%20Utils) - A utils libary that my other libs use with genral useful functions.
- [Whitelist Me](https://github.com/Ruz-on-git/Ruz-s-Figura-Libs/tree/main/Libs/Whitelist%20Me) - A libary for making whitelists for player actions.
- [Simple Wheels](https://github.com/Ruz-on-git/Ruz-s-Figura-Libs/blob/main/Libs/SimpleWheels.lua) - A libary for making action wheels easily.

Other libaries:
- [Extended Json](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua) - Not made by me, the RXI json libary used by some of my other libaries for json work.
